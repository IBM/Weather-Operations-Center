## Crop Yield Forecast Models

The IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture offering includes options for Crop Yield Forecast analytics. The crops and geographies supported within each Option are detailed below. Information will be updated as additional models are made available.

### Yield Forecast Models - Option 1

This option models the seasonal trend in crop yield to prepare for field harvest amount and differences between areas (e.g. fields, regions, markets, etc.).

Date Available | Crop | Applicable Geography | Description of Model
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------
2018 | Corn/Maize (Grain) | North Carolina, South Carolina (US) | Regional crop yield forecast, 10 meter resolution

### Yield Forecast Models - Option 2

This option is designed to assess the impacts of field-level crop productivity factors within the growing season to assist with in-season crop management decisions.

Date Available | Crop | Applicable Geography | Description of Model
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------
Jul 31 2019 (via API) | Soybeans | Brazil, Canada, Mexico | Field-level crop yield forecast, spatialized to 10 meter resolution
